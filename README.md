# Angular2Assign
This is an assignment to gain exposure to Angular 2.

Angular is a complete framework for writing single page applications. When using Angular, you can use a few different languages that all get transpiled to es5 (for now). These include Javascript, Typescript and Dart. There is a focus on Typescript. For this assignment you will be using Typescript.

Learn more about Typescript [here.](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)


#Steps
We will be stating from scratch on this assignment and pushing your finished code to you github account, and turning in a URL to the repo.

# Assignment

Your assignment is to work through the [Angular tutorial.](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)

You will need to turn in 7 commits. One for each chapter of the tutorial, including the quickstart guide.

Include a README file that includes the following:

- Name of project
- Build instructions
- What you learned
- What you found difficult
- Why are .gitignore files important

Also, as part of this assignment, you will need to include a .gitignore file to ignore files that *shouldn't* be tracked by git.



#Tips
- Typescript is a strongly typed language. Learn more about type systems [here.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/introduction-to-programming-type-systems/)
- Angular 2 is a complete rewrite from Angular 1. It is still in open beta, but it is poised to be a big deal in web development.
- Don't worry if you don't understand all the specifics with the details of the framework. Try and keep a broad view of how things connect. At the end of the day, in Angular we are still writing web components. Like what we did in Polymer or React.
- Research .gitignore files and why you should use them.
