# Tour of Heroes

That is the name of this project.

# Build instructions

- Copy repository
- npm install
- npm start
- enjoy the app

*Note*: I assume that I shouldn't have my `.ts` and `.js.map` files included, since those are generated on-the-fly when you run `npm start`, but I couldn't get my `.gitignore` file to obey me.

# What I learned

I learned the basiscs of Angular 2. I learned that it is a lot like React in the way that you build components. I learned that is nothing like Angular 1.whatever, which is what I used previously. So I'm going to try to rebuild my previous Angular app in Angular 2 applying what I learned here.

# What I found difficult

TypeScript is a *little* hard - not that it's difficult to understand, but just because I haven't used it very much. I also found some of the instructions kind of confusing (to be honest, I wouldn't be able to recreate this app from scratch without looking through the tutorial again), and I had to do a lot of re-reading, and to be honest, there are still things I don't get. But I figure that two afternoons working through this tutorial does not an Angular 2 expert make.

# Why are .gitignore files important

They keep unimportant files out of your project, things that can be created on the fly (like my `.ts` and `.min.js`) or things that can be downloaded through `NPM` or `Bower`.
